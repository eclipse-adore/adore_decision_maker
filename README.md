# Decision Maker Node

## Overview
The **Decision Maker Node** orchestrates the vehicle's behavior by determining the appropriate operational state based on real-time conditions and data inputs. It ensures safe, efficient, and responsive driving through a state-based decision-making framework, integrating route planning, trajectory generation, and safety corridor management.

---

## Features
- **State-Based Decision Making**:
  - Seven operational states, prioritized by criticality:
    1. **Safety Corridor**: Navigate within a safety corridor.
    2. **Remote Operation**: Operate under remote control.
    3. **Requesting Assistance**: Handle assistance requests.
    4. **Follow Route**: Follow a predefined route.
    5. **Follow Reference**: Track a given trajectory.
    6. **Standstill**: Halt the vehicle.
    7. **Emergency Stop**: Stop immediately in critical situations.
- **Route Planning and Trajectory Generation**:
  - Supports multiple planners: Lane Following and OptiNLC.
  - Dynamically generates trajectories based on current conditions.
- **Safety Corridor Handling**:
  - Manages trajectories to navigate or escape safety corridors.
  - Supports both JSON and DENM-based safety corridor formats.
- **Remote Operation Support**:
  - Follows waypoints provided during remote operations.
- **Dynamic Environment Awareness**:
  - Adapts to real-time updates from maps, routes, and vehicle states.

## States

### State Prioritization
States are evaluated in the following priority order:
1. **Safety Corridor**:
   - Conditions: `VEHICLE_STATE_OK` and `SAFETY_CORRIDOR_PRESENT`.
   - Generates a trajectory within or escaping the safety corridor.
2. **Remote Operation**:
   - Conditions: `VEHICLE_STATE_OK` and `WAYPOINTS_AVAILABLE`.
   - Follows waypoints during remote control.
3. **Requesting Assistance**:
   - Conditions: `VEHICLE_STATE_OK` and `NEED_ASSISTANCE`.
   - Generates a standstill trajectory and requests assistance.
4. **Follow Route**:
   - Conditions: `VEHICLE_STATE_OK`, `ROUTE_AVAILABLE`, and `LOCAL_MAP_AVAILABLE`.
   - Generates a trajectory to follow a planned route.
5. **Follow Reference**:
   - Conditions: `VEHICLE_STATE_OK` and `REFERENCE_TRAJECTORY_VALID`.
   - Tracks the provided trajectory.
6. **Standstill**:
   - Conditions: `VEHICLE_STATE_OK`.
   - Generates a standstill trajectory.
7. **Emergency Stop**:
   - Conditions: None.
   - Stops the vehicle immediately.
